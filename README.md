# MBARC_datapack
This repository contains tools designed to streamline the packaging of High-Frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP) data for archival with NOAA. It is built upon the file management systems employed by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography's MBARC program and may require modification for use outside of that environment, or for operation on Linux based systems.
